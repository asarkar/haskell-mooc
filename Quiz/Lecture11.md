            putStrLn (y++z)
            ????

**Q**: What values does `blorg [1,2,3]` print? That is, what values `x` does it call `print x` for. The value produced by `blorg` doesnâ€™t count.
```
blorg [] = return 0
blorg (x:xs) = do m <- blorg xs
                  print x
                  return (m+x)
```

a. It prints `1, 2, 3`

b. It prints `1, 2, 3, 6`

c. It prints `3, 2, 1`

d. It prints `3, 2, 1, 6`

**A**: `c` is the correct answer.
